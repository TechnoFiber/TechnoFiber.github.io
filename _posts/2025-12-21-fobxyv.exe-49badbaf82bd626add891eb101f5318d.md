# Malware Analysis Report – stealer.exe

**Report Version:** v1.0  
**Analyst:** technofiber  
**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-22  
**Environment:** Isolated Malware Analysis Lab (FLARE-VM, Windows 10 x64)

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the analysis of a Windows-based **information-stealing malware**, examined in a fully isolated and controlled lab environment for defensive and educational purposes only.

The malware is designed to harvest **browser credentials, cookies, browsing history, cryptocurrency wallets, messaging application data, system metadata, and screenshots**, followed by **local staging and attempted data exfiltration**.

The sample exhibits **active defense evasion**, including the **automatic termination of analysis and monitoring tools upon execution**, as well as cryptographic protection of collected data.  
No production systems were affected during this analysis.

---

## Static Analysis

### File Identification

- **File Format:** Windows PE
- **Architecture:** AMD64
- **Entropy Observations:** Elevated entropy in multiple sections, indicating encrypted or compressed data
- **Suspicious Characteristics:** Runtime API resolution, cryptographic routines, embedded SQLite and Zlib references

---

### Import Address Table (IAT)

Observed imports and resolved APIs indicate support for:

- Process enumeration and termination
- File system traversal and data harvesting
- Registry access
- Cryptographic operations
- Network communication
- Screenshot capture

Notable APIs observed include:

- CreateProcessA / OpenProcess
- ReadFile / WriteFile / DeleteFile
- GetFileAttributes
- LoadLibrary / GetProcAddress
- BCryptEncrypt / BCryptGenRandom
- BitBlt / GdipSaveImageToFile
- InternetConnect / HttpSendRequest

---

### Strings Analysis

Extracted strings reveal extensive targeting and evasion logic, including:

#### Anti-Analysis & Tool Detection
- Procmon.exe, Procmon64.exe
- Wireshark.exe
- ProcessExplorer.exe, procexp.exe
- ProcessHacker.exe, SystemInformer.exe
- x32dbg.exe, x64dbg.exe, OllyDbg.exe
- IDA.exe, ida64.exe, WinDbg.exe
- Malwarebytes (mbam.exe)

#### Browser Data Targets
- Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Yandex, Comodo Dragon, UR
- Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data
- Local Extension Settings

#### Wallet & Crypto Targets
- Exodus
- Electrum
- Bitcoin Core
- Atomic Wallet
- Browser-based wallet extensions

#### Messaging Applications
- Telegram
- Discord
- Tox
- 64Gram

#### Messaging Applications
- Malware takes screenshots

## Dynamic Analysis

### Execution Behavior

Upon execution, the malware performs the following actions:

- Enumerates running processes
- Actively **terminates monitoring and analysis tools**
- Dynamically loads required Windows libraries
- Spawns multiple threads for parallel collection tasks

Renaming analysis tools (e.g., Procmon) allowed observation, confirming **name-based detection and termination logic**.

---

### File System Activity

The malware creates a dedicated staging directory under:

- C:\ProgramData\{35c7992a-c8fe-11f0-b03e-806e6f6e6963}

Collected data is organized into structured subdirectories, including:

- Browsers
- Wallets
- Messengers
- FTP Clients

Additional files observed:

- Info.txt
- Windows_Info.txt
- Software_Info.txt
- Screenshot.jpg

This structure suggests preparation for operator-side review after exfiltration.

---

### Registry Activity

Observed registry interaction includes:

- HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\fobxyv.exe
- HKCR\AppID\fobxyv.exe
- HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\<SID>\fobxyv.exe

These entries create clear forensic artifacts and may support execution tracking or evasion.

---

### Windows Error Reporting (WER) Abuse

The malware invokes WerFault.exe with custom parameters, generating artifacts under:

- C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue\AppCrash_fobxyv.exe_*

This behavior suggests abuse of Windows Error Reporting to interfere with crash handling or obscure abnormal execution.

---

## Network Activity

### Observed Connections

| Attribute | Observation |
|--------|------------|
| Destination IP | 62.60.226.159 |
| Destination Port | 27015 |
| Protocol | TCP |
| Method | POST |
| User-Agent | Mozilla/5.0 |

Multiple SYN retransmissions were observed, indicating unreachable or intentionally silent C2 infrastructure.

Data appears to be packaged as encrypted and compressed ZIP archives before transmission.

---

## Command and Control (C2)

| Attribute | Observation |
|--------|------------|
| Connection Type | Reverse |
| Protocol | TCP / HTTP-like |
| Encryption | Yes |
| Observed Ports | 27015 |
